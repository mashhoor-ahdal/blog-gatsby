Starting a new job is always exciting, but nothing quite compares to the thrill of your **first job**. On **June 19, 2024**, I began my journey as a **Software Engineer Intern** at **X Company**, and it has been an unforgettable experience full of challenges, growth, and countless learning moments.

### Getting Started: Training in Web Scraping

The first few weeks were all about training, specifically on **web scraping**. Our tasks involved gathering data from websites efficiently, which is no easy feat. I was introduced to some key tools and concepts:

- **Asyncio**: An essential Python library for asynchronous programming, allowing us to handle multiple requests without blocking the main process.
- **Multithreading** and **Multiprocessing**: These were invaluable for running several tasks simultaneously, which is crucial in web scraping to handle large amounts of data.

#### Challenges and Lessons Learned

Learning to manage these tools effectively was challenging, especially understanding the nuances of concurrency. However, the training provided a solid foundation that I would rely on throughout my internship.

### Building a Full-Stack Application

Once the web scraping training was complete, I moved on to **full-stack development training**. Our main project was to build a **Rick and Morty website** from scratch, which allowed us to implement both **backend** and **frontend** skills.

- **Backend**: We used **Django** to build a REST API that served data on characters and episodes.
- **Frontend**: Built using **React**, creating a dynamic user experience with filtering and pagination features.
- **Deployment**: The project was deployed using **Docker** and **Nginx** with **Gunicorn** to handle high traffic and ensure smooth performance.

This project taught me how to bring together multiple technologies into a cohesive application. I learned how to structure code, handle API requests, and design intuitive user interfaces.

### Developing a Web Scraping Framework

With my foundation in web scraping and full-stack development, I was next assigned a project to build a **web scraping framework**. The goal was to create a scalable and maintainable framework that adhered to **SOLID principles**.

#### Key Features of the Framework

- **Kafka Integration**: We used **Kafka** as a producer-consumer messaging system to handle the flow of data between different components of the framework.
- **Unit Testing**: To ensure reliability, we wrote extensive unit tests. I learned how to use **monkey patching** to replace certain parts of the code with test-specific logic, especially for testing complex behaviors like infinite loops.

### Transitioning to Full-Stack Developer

As my internship progressed, I was thrilled to be assigned to the **App Team** as a **Full-Stack Developer**. My new responsibilities allowed me to work on impactful features and apply all the skills I’d learned so far.

#### Current Responsibilities

- **Django Backend Development**: Working on backend APIs that power the core features of our applications.
- **React and TypeScript**: Developing robust and type-safe frontend components using **React with TypeScript** to create a seamless user experience.
- **Collaborative Workflows**: Collaborating with other team members to ensure consistency and code quality across the app.

### Reflections

Each phase of my journey has contributed to my growth, both technically and personally. I am grateful to my mentors and teammates at **X Company** for their guidance and support. I’m excited to continue developing my skills and making meaningful contributions to the app team and beyond.
