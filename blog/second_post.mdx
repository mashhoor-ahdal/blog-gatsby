Understanding Power of Two in Python:

In Python, determining whether a number is a power of two can be efficiently done using bitwise operations. Here's a Python solution to check if a number is a power of two:

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n > 0 and ((n & (n - 1)) == 0)
```
